## Overview

Option 2 is a Claude Code-inspired interface that showcases how an AI assistant can execute tasks across multiple connected services (Zoho CRM, Zoho Desk, Slack, Google Calendar) and display beautifully formatted execution results.

**Key Focus**: This is a **demo/showcase interface** with mock data - no real API integrations.

## What This Is

A chat-based AI interface where users can:
- Ask the AI to perform cross-service tasks
- See step-by-step execution results
- View status indicators (✅ success, ❌ needs attention, ℹ️ info)
- Click example prompts to see demos
- Experience a Claude-like workflow for business automation

- **Port**: 3004

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies

## Comparison: Option 1 vs Option 2

| Feature | Option 1 | Option 2 |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **Type** | Support Ticket Dashboard | AI Task Assistant |
| **Interface** | Dashboard with stats/heatmap | Chat interface |
| **Interaction** | Click and manage tickets | Ask AI to perform tasks |
| **Display** | Real-time ticket status | Step-by-step execution results |
| **Focus** | Manual ticket management | Automated cross-service tasks |
| **Port** | 3000 | 3004 |
| **Theme** | Solar Dusk | Solar Dusk |

## Key Differences from Option 1

**Option 1**: Traditional dashboard for managing support tickets manually
**Option 2**: AI-powered assistant that executes tasks and shows what it did

## Demo Purpose

This is a **UI showcase** demonstrating:
